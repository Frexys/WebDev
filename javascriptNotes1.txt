Objectives:

a) 5 primitive data types
b) Numbers and numeric operators
c) Strings and common string methods


Data types:

Numbers, e.g. 4, 9.3, -10. There are just numbers, no floats, doubles, ints etc.

Strings, e.g. "Hello World", "43"

Booleans, i.e. true, false

null

undefined



NUMBERS:

We can do numbers: 4, 9.3, -10 etc..

Math: 4 + 10, 1/5

Modulo: 10%3 = 1, 24%2 = 0, 15%11 = 4 etc.




STRINGS:

Numbers or characters inside of quotes (single or double, but must be conistent).

Concatenation: "charlie" + "brown" = "charliebrown"

Escape characters with \, e.g. "She said \"goodbye\" ".

All strings have .length property

Access individual letters using [] and an index: "hello"[4] = "o"




Exercises:
100%3: 1

("blah"+"blah")[6] = 'a'

"hello".length % "hi\\".length = 5%3 = 2
